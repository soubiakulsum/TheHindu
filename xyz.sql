"LG confirms it's shutting down its mobile business",
44,
"Forty-five Assembly seats spread across six districts of the State will go to polls in the fifth phase of polling in West Bengal on April 17. Of the 45 seats, 13 are going to polls in north Bengal and 32 seats will vote in south Bengal. This is the highest number of seats going to polls in any of the eight-phase marathon Assembly elections. Thirteen seats in north Bengal are spread across three districts of north Bengal — five in Darjeeling, seven in Jalpaiguri and one in Kalimpong. In south Bengal, 16 seats are spread across North 24 Parganas, and there are eight each in Nadia and Bardhaman districts. The seats going to polls stretch from the northernmost point of the State in the Darjeeling hills to Basirhat Uttar and Basirhat Dakshin in the Sunderbans. Elections are being held in the tea gardens of the Dooars and also in the urban and rural settlements of North 24 Parganas, Bardhaman and Nadia. A total of 1.13 crore voters are eligible to cast their votes to decide the fate of 342 candidates. Key candidates include senior Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and Siliguri Mayor Asok Bhattacharya, contesting from Siliguri; State Minister Bratya Basu, who is contesting from Dum Dum in the northern fringes of Kolkata; and State Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya from Rajarhat’s Gopalpukur seat in North 24 Parganas. In north Bengal, one of the key poll issues is the suffering of tea garden workers labouring under poor wages both in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri, while agrarian distress continues to be the main issue in Bardhaman and other rural areas of the State. Both the BJP and the TMC have sparred over the benefits of the Centre’s PM Kisan Samman Nidhi and the State government’s Krishak Bandhu scheme, respectively. In districts like North 24 Parganas and Nadia, the contest will be centred around the inroads made by the BJP in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls and the subsequent resistance of the Trinamool Congress. In many of the 45 seats, both the ruling TMC and the BJP are evenly poised. In certain pockets in north Bengal and Bardhaman, the Samyukta Morcha of the Left, the Congress and the Indian Secular Fund (ISF) can make a difference. The BJP ensured that all its heavyweight campaigners, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, party president J.P. Nadda and actor Mithun Chakraborty, addressed several meetings. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool Congress MP Abhishek Banerjee have campaigned in areas going to polls. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also campaigned in Darjeeling district at the eleventh hour for Samyukta Morcha candidates. A lot has changed since the previous phase of the ongoing Assembly polls was held on April 10. The death of four persons on polling day at Sitalkuchi after Central forces opened fire, and the Election Commission of India barring Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and State BJP leaders Dilip Ghosh and Rahul Sinha, from campaigning for a period, has added a new dimension to the fifth phase."

Dzeko the saviour Dzeko tapped in with 18 minutes to go as the host held on to reach the final four of a European competition for the second time in four seasons after the Champions League in 2018. United had few problems against Granada, which had a mountain to climb after losing the first leg 2-0 in Spain.Edinson Cavani opened the scoring after just five minutes to put United ahead and Jesus Valleho’s last-minute own goal sealed the win for United, which could yet have an all-English final with Arsenal. Thumping win The Gunners will face Villarreal in a fortnight after cruising past Slavia Prague 4-0 to go through 5-1 on aggregate. Behind on away goals, Arsenal ended Slavia’s 23-match unbeaten run thanks to a six-minute blitz in the first half that sealed the tie.

With 24 minutes on the clock, Bukayo Saka made it three with a driving run and drilled near post finish.

Unai Emery is on course to claim his fourth Europa League crown as a coach after Villarreal team made short work of Dinamo Zagreb in a 2-1 win to qualify 3-1 on aggregate. Paco Alacer opened the scoring nine minutes before the break before Gerard Moreno fired home his sixth goal in the competition in the 43rd minute.

"Krishan Pathak primed for Tokyo Games",
47,
"Young goalkeeper Krishan Pathak, who was one of the architects of India’s superb show against Argentina, said he wants to be in top form for the Tokyo Olympics and is eyeing another superlative performance against Great Britain in the FIH Pro League games next month. The 23-year-old, who earned his 50th international cap during India’s tour of Argentina, played a big role in his side registering back-to-back victories against the reigning Olympic champion in the FIH Pro League this month. “I am very happy to have completed 50 international caps. So much has happened in such a short space of time. I have had the opportunity to play in big tournaments and learnt a lot from my seniors,” Pathak said in a release issued by Hockey India. “The coaches have always believed in my talent. I want to continue working hard and win games for India. Reaching this milestone makes me proud.”Impressive While fellow custodian P.R. Sreejesh was brilliant when the visitor won the first match in a penalty shoot-out, Pathak was equally impressive during India’s 3-0 win over the host in the second game. “I got to learn a lot from the Argentina tour. I know I have to prove my worth as a goalkeeper every time I am playing,” said Pathak. “I feel we showed a lot of fight and character there. Over the past year, we’ve had good games against the top sides in the world and I feel that gives us the right kind of boost going into a tournament like the Olympics.” India will play Great Britain in the FIH Pro League on May 8 and 9. “We have to be focussed on the job at hand right now. Hope our good form continues against Great Britain,” Pathak said. For much of his career, Pathak has been Sreejesh’s understudy and thinks the competition for places has only made him better. “There’s so much one can learn from Sreejesh. He’s been playing at the highest level for so many years,” he said. “I have improved as a custodian in the last four years and that is because of what I have gathered and learnt watching people like Sreejesh and others play and train on a daily basis.”",

"Billie Jean King Cup | Ostapenko outlasts Ankita",
48,
"Former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko overcame a fiercely determined Ankita Raina 6-2, 5-7, 7-5 to put host Latvia 1-0 ahead in the Billie Jean King Cup World Group playoff tie at the indoor arena in Jurmala on Friday. With the Indian leading 5-4 in the third set, the 23-year-old Ostapenko handled the climactic phase like a champion. However, the 28-year-old Ankita couldn’t close it out, opening the door for the Latvian. Perhaps, a better start could have helped Ankita. Not used to facing an opponent of such quality seemed to be playing on the Indian’s mind as she decided to go on an all-out attack and kept making errors. Though Ostapenko, too, struggled with her serve and strokes, Ankita was unable to capitalise on the opportunities that came her way. Precise and purposeful After shrugging off the excitement of the first set, Ankita was a lot more precise and purposeful in the second set. She jumped to a 2-0 lead and stretched it to 5-2.However, Ostapenko, who found her serving rhythm, fought back. Ankita kept her cool, ran hard during the rallies and placed the ball well to force errors from the Latvian. At 5-6, Ostapenko’s serve let her down again, taking the contest to the decider. After being treated for a hip strain, she got off to a smooth start in the third set. While the Latvian No. 2 became more confident and solid, Ankita’s accuracy failed her at a crucial juncture though she continued to put in the hard yards. Ankita played well above her ranking of 174, pushing a Grand Slam champion to the limit. In the second singles, Anastasija Sevastova breezed past Karman Kaur Thandi 6-4, 6-0. After giving it her all in the first set, the latter ran out of steam as Sevastova made her scamper around the court. The reverse singles and doubles will be held on Saturday, and India will hope to come up with something special. The results: Latvia leads India 2-0 (Jelena Ostapenko bt Ankita Raina 6-2, 5-7, 7-5; Anastasija Sevastova bt Karman Kaur Thandi 6-4, 6-0).",

"Rossi has taught me everything I know, says Morbidelli",
49,
"The 2020 MotoGP season saw an exciting title fight and a new crop of winners emerge in the absence of six-time champion Marc Marquez, who missed the season due to an injury during the first round in Qatar. One such rider was Franco Morbidelli who quickly established himself as the new star on the horizon by finishing second in the championship with three wins and two podiums. The 26-year-old, groomed by legend Valentino Rossi since his junior days at the VR46 Riders Academy in Tavullia (Italy), has teamed up with his mentor at Petronas Yamaha SRT for the 2021 season. “VR 46 has taught me everything I know about professional racing. I have always been a quick rider throughout my early career, but the core of my knowledge about professional racing is made by the team at VR46,” said Morbidelli during a chat with The Hindu on Thursday. “Everything I know about being a pro rider — how to train, how to eat, how to behave — I have got it from Vale (Rossi),” he added.Now teammates, Morbidelli said he can learn more from the seven-time MotoGP champion. “Spending time in the same environment will give me a chance to learn other things. I don’t know which ones because I will know them just at that moment and imbibe them.” However, the 2021 season has not started well for the 2020 vice-champion with just four points from the first two races in Qatar. “It is tough, especially after the results I did throughout the second half of last season, to see myself struggling so much in the first two races. But this is MotoGP and if you’re not in the perfect shape, you lose many positions,” said Morbidelli. “(But) we have great trust in ourselves. We will have to regroup and face remaining races with great energy because we know what we can do.” (MotoGP is live on Eurosport, Eurosport HD and live-streamed on Discovery+ from 3.30 p.m. on Sunday).",

"Divya clinches second Asian gold",
50,
"Divya Kakran emerged as the second Indian woman to secure two gold medals in the Asian wrestling championships on Friday as women wrestlers of the country returned four gold medals in Almaty, Kazakhstan. In the continental event marred by the absence of strong countries China and Japan, three Indian women — Divya (72kg), Vinesh Phogat (53kg) and Anshu Malik (57kg) — bagged gold medals. Only Rio Olympics bronze medallist Sakshi Malik settled for silver in 65kg. A day after Sarita Mor became the first Indian woman to win two Asian titles, Divya, who had claimed the 68kg crown in New Delhi a year ago, took the gold in a depleted 72kg field consisting of just four wrestlers. Divya defeated Tsevegmed Enkhbayar of Mongolia 2-0 and Zhamila Bakbergenova of Kazakhstan 8-5.Divya beat Korean Sujin Park 2-0 in her last bout. Olympic-qualified wrestler Vinesh beat Otgonjargal Ganbaatar of Mongolia 11-0 and Meng Hsuan Hsieh of Chinese Taipei 12-0 in the group stage. She reached the final as her Korean opponent Hyunyoung Oh forfeited her match due to an injury. Vinesh then defeated Meng by fall to clinch her maiden title. “The main aim was to wrestle the Japan and China wrestlers, but they are not here. If there is a gold medal on the offering, I will take it,” she said. Anshu cruised against Sevara Eshmuratova of Uzbekistan 10-0, Nazira Marsbek Kyzy of Kyrgyzstan 10-0 and Battsetseg Altantseseg of Mongolia 9-1 before overcoming Korean Shinhye Lee with a 2-2 scoreline. Anshu again beat Battsetseg 3-0 in the final to claim her first Asian gold. Sakshi, who could not win the 62kg Olympic weight trials and qualified in 65kg, lost the summit clash to Bolortungalag Zorigt of Mongolia via fall.",

"Assam Assembly Elections | Now, BPF sends its candidates abroad",
51,
"What the All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) can do, ally Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) can do better. Two days after the AIUDF and Congress packed at least 20 of their candidates off to a luxury hotel in Congress-ruled Rajasthan, the BPF sent 10 candidates overseas, apparently amid fears of horse-trading by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) prior to the declaration of the Assembly election results on May 2. The Congress, AIUDF and BPF are the main constituents of the 10-party Mahajot and grand alliance that contested the three-phase State polls. An ally of the BJP during the 2016 polls, the BPF had fielded 12 candidates this time. But Rangja Khungur Basumatary, its candidate for the Tamulpur seat, joined the BJP six days ahead of the third and final phase of polling on April 6.Of the remaining 11, all except Minister Pramila Rani Brahma exited Assam on Saturday. There is speculation that they are in adjoining Bhutan, whose nearest point is a few hours drive from western Assam’s Kokrajhar town, where all the candidates were asked to assembly by BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary. “They [the candidates] have left Assam. I have also heard they are out of India, but I cannot say where they have gone as I have not been able to get in touch with them,” Ms. Brahma said. She also said more than a dozen elected members of the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) could have left Assam. “They may have gone on vacation or are away because of the possibility of horse-trading at the council level,” she added. The BPF had emerged as the single largest party in the BTC election in December 2020 but the BJP formed the government there in alliance with the United People’s Party Liberal. The State unit of Congress has expressed the need to exercise caution because of the possibility of the BJP trying to lure Mahajot candidates away in the event of a tight finish when the Assembly election results are declared on May 2. “We must be cautious in order to beat the BJP’s anti-democracy moves. From the past, we know the BJP can go to any length for a Congress-free India. They prevented us from forming governments in Goa, Manipur and Sikkim,” Congress MLA Devabrata Saikia said.",

"Kerala Assembly elections | Capital district records 70.01% turnout in peaceful polling",
52,
"The capital district recorded a polling percentage of 70.01% in the Assembly elections on Tuesday, as per the latest information available with the Election Commission. The numbers were bound to slightly increase with the final update of data from polling booths. In the Assembly elections of 2016, the district had recorded a polling percentage of 72.02%. Polling was largely peaceful across the district, except for an isolated incident of violence involving BJP and CPI(M) workers at Kattayikonam in the Kazhakuttam constituency. Police force was deployed in large numbers in the area to prevent further violence. As in the past, the rural areas of the district were ahead of the urban regions in voter enthusiasm, with most of the urban constituencies recording polling percentages lower than 70% and the rural constituencies recording more than 70%. The Aruvikkara constituency, consisting of remote polling stations in the high ranges, recorded the highest polling percentage of 73.27%, while the Thiruvananthapuram constituency in the heart of the city with easily accessible booths had a polling percentage of 61.92%. Nemom, the sole constituency won by the BJP in the State ever and which this year witnessed a tight triangular fight, had a relatively low polling percentage of 69.80%, compared to 74.11% in 2016.The case was similar in Kazhakuttam as well, which had a polling percentage of 69.63%, as against 73.46% last time. Shift in pattern The coastal regions witnessed a significant shift in voting pattern, as serpentine queues that used to be a common sight along the belt were missing this time. The setting up of auxiliary stations on account of the pandemic prevented crowding within the polling stations. COVID-19 protocol was largely adhered to across the district. While physical distancing could not be enforced owing to paucity of space in some booths, all other precautions were adopted. An adequate stock of disposable masks kept ready at all stations proved useful, with some voters, especially in the coastal areas, turning up without such protective gear.",

"West Bengal Assembly Elections | Phase 5 witnesses high turnout and sporadic violence",
54,
"High voter turnout and sporadic incidents of violence marked the fifth phase of elections in West Bengal on April 17. Polling was held in 45 Assembly seats across six districts — three in north Bengal and three in the south. Till 5 p.m., 78.36% electors had exercised their franchise. Highest voting (81.73%) was observed in Jalpiaguri, followed by Purba Bardhaman (81.72%) and Nadia (81.57%). The voting percentage is expected to rise. While local residents alleged that there was firing at Deganga Assembly segment in North 24 Parganas by central armed police forces, a report by the Superintendent of Police, Barasat stated the allegation was not based on any facts. West Bengal elections phase 5 updates | April 17, 2021 “The Elections were peaceful today a few incidents were reported,” Chief Electoral Officer Aariz Aftab said. The CEO said that 23 persons were arrested in specific incidents during the day and 100 were arrested as part of preventive arrested. At Ranaghat in Nadia, independent candidate Kaushik Bhowmick was arrested after a firearm was recovered from him. Violence was reported at Santipur police station area in Nadia when miscreants lobbed crude bombs on a person, who suffered injuries, and was admitted to a hospital. At Gayeshpur in Nadia, the house of the BJP supporter was damaged. Supporters of Trinamool Congress broke the door of the BJP supporter with sticks , barged into and ransacked his house. The CEO said that senior police officers are in Gayeshpur, and police will be stationed in the area. Other than Nadia where eight Assembly seats went to polls, violence between supporters of two groups of people were reported in North 24 Parganas where 16 Assembly seats went to polls. Biddhanagar and Baranagar, two constituencies bordering Kolkata, witnessed violent scenes when supporters of Trinamool and BJP clashed. The supporters of each political group hurled bricks and stones towards each other in Shantinagar area of Bidhannagar Assembly constituency. The supporters of Trinamool and BJP came face to face and exchanged blows. A huge contingent of central forces had to be rushed in to control the situation. Tension prevailed in the area for hours and candidates of both parties visited the area. In Baranagar seat, BJP candidate and actor Parno Mitra was allegedly gheraoed by Trinamool activists while she was touring the constituency. Later in the day, the Trinamool supporters alleged that central forces personnel used force against them. In the adjoining Kamarhati constituency, BJP candidate Raju Banerjee alleged that he was attacked by Trinamool supporters at the behest of party candidate Madan Mitra. In the fifth phase of elections, the ECI deployed 1,071 company of central forces, the highest deployment so far. Despite the unprecedented deployment of forces, voters and polling agents saying that they are being threatened were not completely absent. At Minakha in North 24 Parganas, family members of a polling agent alleged that the agent was abducted. There were reports of scuffle in Bardhaman including at Monteshwar where the Trinamool candidate Siddiqulah Chowdhury alleged that central forces used force against party supporters. Polling was peaceful in north Bengal where elections were held in 13 seats in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpiaguri. Record spike of COVID cases The polling was held on a day when the State registered a record 7,713 new COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours. The number of deaths also increased significantly in the past 24 hours with 34 people succumbing to the viral infection. The Election Commission has barred political parties from campaigning from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m. and extended the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours in each of the remaining three phases of polls. On April 16, the State recorded 6,910 new cases with 26 deaths.",

"Trinamool Congress is pressurising the Election Commission, says Modi",
55,
"Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday accused the Trinamool Congress (TMC) of putting pressure on the Election Commission of India (EC) to thwart the polling process in West Bengal. Addressing a public meeting at Asansol in Paschim Bardhaman, Mr. Modi said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was “trying all means to subvert and stop the elections”. “This time Didi (Ms. Banerjee) and her party are not being allowed to resort to rigging during the election. This is the reason why she is trying all means to subvert and stop the elections,” Mr. Modi said. The PM’s remarks come at a time when the TMC has urged the EC to merge the remaining three phases of polls in West Bengal due to an outbreak of COVID-19. Polling in the fifth phase of the Assembly elections was underway on Saturday. During his address, Mr. Modi raised the issue of the 2018 panchayat election in the State, and said that the people of Bengal had not forgotten how their democratic rights had been subverted during the local elections. “In 20,000 seats, which is almost one third of the total seats, TMC candidates won without a contest. Those who had filed their nomination from the Opposition had to take shelter in other States. Nomination papers had to submitted over the Internet on WhatsApp,” he said. The Prime Minister also referred to the communal riots in Asansol for three years on the occasion of Ram Navami celebrations and blamed the Chief Minister for the violence. “Who stood with rioters, who were indulging in politics of appeasement?” Mr. Modi asked the gathering. On the deaths at Sitalkuchi in the previous phase of polling, the Prime Minister said that the Chief Minister was indulging in politics over the deaths. On Friday, the BJP leadership had released audio tapes of a conversation between Ms. Banerjee and the TMC candidate after the Central Armed Forces opened fire resulting in the death of four persons at Jor Patki gram panchayat in Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar district. The TMC leadership said that there was nothing wrong in the conversation and raised questions over the taping of telephones of TMC leaders. Mr. Modi, who promised ₹18,000 to every farmer as pending benefits from the PM Kisan scheme for the past three years, alleged that Ms. Banerjee had stood as a wall between West Bengal’s people and Central welfare schemes. Later in the day, addressing another public meeting at Gangarampur in north Bengal, the Prime Minister said that politics had “crossed dangerous limits of vengeance”. “Mamata Banerjee is abusing me almost every day as I raise the Trinamool Congress’s track record of corruption,” Mr. Modi said, referring to several remarks directed by the CM towards him in the last week of March and April. Defending his mode of addressing the Chief Minister as “ Didi-O-Didi”, he said that during the entire election, he had been referring to Ms. Banerjee as “Didi” and was “sometimes saying it twice”.",

"Santanu Hazarika and his world of cyborg queens and laser kings",
56,
"In Santanu Hazarika’s portrait of close friend, actor Shruti Haasan, she is half-human, half-robot, and wears a demure gaze, strokes of a yellow sun rising like wings from her back. A haloed Mother Mary — if she were a cyborg. Cool blue metallic portraits might be the Guwahati-native artist’s latest obsession, but the core idea still reflects his trademark affinity towards creating comic book characters out of people. Winner of the world’s first Red Bull World Doodle Art Champion in 2014, Santanu has been steadily building a name for himself in the world of visual art. His art finds a place in the albums of musicians such as Raftaar, Ritviz and Divine; on sneakers by Adidas and Reebok; as graffiti on walls; and most recently, on a Rajasthan Royals tour bus, for this year’s IPL season.Over the phone from Mumbai, where he is based out of now, Santanu explains how his fascination with comic books drew him to the world of art. “I designed the artwork for Major Lazer and Nucleya’s mix, ‘Jadi Buti’, in which these two characters: Bass Raja [drawn like an Indian king, an Amar Chitra Katha man with more defined abs] and DJ Lazer [a Jamaican hero shooting out lasers] are on a comic book cover,” he says. “These are two wildly different characters from different universes, in a crossover scene.”Without any formal training in the subject, comics — from Spiderman and X-Men to Spawn and Dragon Ball Z, were his first inspiration. Headbanging to art “Back in school, I would draw sketches of these characters for friends, to earn canteen money,” recalls Santanu. A quid pro quo, he would continue well into engineering college (this time, for pints of beer).“It was a bad phase for me. I really wanted to drop out, and take up graphic designing or animation, but I couldn’t. I had to undergo therapy for my depression. I would sit in class and just sketch all the time, even the teachers had given up on me,” he says. However, at the same time, word of his work spread and his musician friends in local bands from Guwahati and Shillong started requesting him to design their album art and equipment. Running parallel to his interest in drawing, was his interest in metal music, and the two fed into each other. “I loved listening to bands such as Iron Maiden, Megadeath, Cannibal Corpse,” he says. But what he loved just as much was looking at their album art. “Most of my artwork even now, is inspired by these old metal bands. They know how to give a face to their music. This idea of musical sounds lending to a visual representation is very interesting to me,” he says. Not surprisingly then, Santanu’s work has found favour in India’s growing indie music market, where musicians and artists alike are trying to carve a space that’s rebelliously un-Bollywood and yet Indian at heart. It shows in his work for Mc Altaf And Ikka of Gully Gang, and Seedhe Maut.",

"Koodiyattam on a wooden stool!",
57,
"One of the striking features of Kerala’s classical theatre forms is the concept of the use of space. Even while presenting larger-than-life mythological narratives, the size of the stage used in Koodiyattam or Kathakali is ideally around 150 sq. ft. The theory of body kinetics in these art forms emphasises the use of the eyes, face and the entire body in minimal space with the least movements to create the maximum impact. The act of lifting a mountain or crossing an ocean, for example, is done more with limbs and muscles and not through spatial movement. Koodiyattam goes even further in certain plays, and practically shrinks the stage to a wooden stool or peetam that is about 2 ft in diameter. One such instance is in the play Asokavanikankam, where Ravana, seeing Sita for the first time from his airborne chariot, is overcome with wonder and passion. Two descriptive segments Acting out the sloka ‘Indranimaham’ while standing on the peetam also involves two popular descriptive segments of Koodiyattam — ‘Kailasoddharanam’ and ‘Parvathiviraham’. While the former requires the actor to have a supple body to describe how Ravana tossed up Mount Kailas when his flying chariot was blocked by the mountain, the latter demands an expressive face to narrate the Siva and Parvati dialogue. Watching this solo act by Nepathya Rahul Chakyar at Nepathya Moozhikkulam in a four-hour ‘Nirvahanam’ or Retrospective segment is a lesson on how to use the body in Koodiyattam. Rahul was on the peetam for nearly two and a half hours, beginning from Ravana describing Sita’s beauty to recalling his visit to the prison where he had imprisoned the celestial beauties. To narrate how he saw Parvati doleful and angry, Ravana first describes the story of how he lifted and threw Mount Kailas. Only in the last segment of ‘Parvathiviraham,’ did the dancer get to sit down. Creating an imaginary mountain for the audience is no easy task. As he marvels at the majestic Kailas, Rahul stands tall on the stool, bends sideways, leans backwards, stands on tiptoe, and stoops low to trace the contours of the mountain. Then he goes on to describe its various features such as caves and sheer rock faces. Supported by the vibrant mizhavu and idakka drums, Rahul makes the audience experience water dropping from the mountain’s crevices and gathering strength to form a river. Rahul uses the peetam as if it was an extension of his limbs and finally he uproots the mountain and tosses it up high into the sky.How does this act differ from his other Koodiyattam roles? Rahul says there is much less freedom when standing on the stool and one has to scale down movements. The attaprakaram or the stage manual makes no allowance for changes in costume or actions in the descriptive passages to offset the space constraints. The challenge, says Rahul, is to create the same impact within the limited space. Performing while standing on a stool demands more concentration and stamina, since one has to always be aware of the foot position while at the same time maintaining the right expressions. The inputs needed, therefore, to create the same viewer experience are more when performing in a space that is a fraction of the normal stage. Rahul has performed this role twice before but in a pacha costume. This is the first time he is doing it in Ravana’s kathi make-up, which is more difficult because of the bigger headgear. “Rigorous practice is essential to avoid even a small misstep,” says Rahul. Initial lessons, when his guru taught him this sequence, took roughly one month. Nowadays, he practises for about a week before such a performance. Rahul believes that the beauty of Koodiyattam lies in creating a big impact by using one’s eyes and body to project maximum energy. The author, a retired journalist, writes on Kerala’s performing arts.",

"10 of Vivekh’s most iconic comedy roles in Tamil cinema",
58,
"A pall of gloom has descended on the Tamil film industry — and people like us who consume movies for entertainment — following the untimely demise of comedian-actor Vivekh at the age of 59. It is a hard pill to swallow considering the man more than once managed to succeed in making us laugh our hearts out to his antics on screen. Also Read | Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here His brand of comedy — unmatched as it is — most often involved a commentary-style criticism of things that burden or impact society; the criticism, however, came mixed with self-deprecatory or slapstick humour. Vivekh was also a master at imitation, having played characters that represent a stereotype or are modelled on famous names in Tamil cinema. Vivekh’s contributions to Tamil cinema has been acknowledged by the Government of Tamil Nadu numerous times, and his characters — impactful as they were during the time — remain deeply embedded in Tamil society’s memory fabric. Here, we remember the comedian and actor by rewinding the clock and looking at 10 of his iconic roles from among the many he brought to life on screen. Disclaimer: This list is in no way a definitive collection of Vivekh’s best works, but is only intended to serve as a tribute to a departed screen legend. 1. Pennin Manathai Thottu (2000) As Kandasamy, the medical college student/son of the local MLA, Vivekh delivered perhaps the most iconic of comedy dialogues ever delivered in Tamil cinema in the new millennium. Ringing up the late Dr Mathrubootham at midnight and asking him: “Neenga verum Das ah, illa Lord Labakku Das ah?” cracked up a generation of Tamil movie buffs, and continues to do so till date. His many gags after exposing his derriere to burn injuries was also one of the key reasons that made this film at least watchable. 2. Lovely (2001) As a film, Lovely wouldn’t exist for Tamil movie buffs if not for the intervention provided by Vivekh. Playing Azhages aka Al Gates, Vivekh’s run-ins with the ‘Monkey gulla’ group — and the laughter-inducing BGM every time they turn him into pulp and drop him on a hospital bed — was a hoot.",

59,
"Gentle giant… that would best describe P. Vasanth Kumar, musician, mentor and writer, who passed away on Saturday. He was 65. He is survived by his wife, a son and daughter. Son of the late Sulochana Pattabhiraman, eminent musician and musicologist, he was a member of the Executive Committee of The Music Academy. It was in the company of the seven notes that he grew up, literally, imbibing the best from veterans. He carried his scholarship with aplomb and rare humility. A dedicated teacher, he imparted his knowledge holding nothing back, very much like his mother. After her demise, he took her young disciples under his wings, making the transition smooth. He not only nurtured talent, but helped merit find platform. A reliable resource person for The Hindu Friday Review, he contributed flawless write-ups. His radar would pick up any mistakes in reports on music. A gifted disciple of the doyen Pitchumani Iyer, Vasanth Kumar was a torchbearer of that pristine legacy, his veena producing pure melody. A connoisseur of all styles of music, he was an ardent fan of MLV. “It turned out that we named him perfectly,” chuckled his mother once, talking about Vasanth’s adoration of the genius. “He had details about MLV’s concerts on his fingertips,” says violin exponent Kanyakumari, for whom Vasanth was like a brother. He had an encyclopaedic knowledge of music to whom we could turn to clear any doubt,” she says. “I have lost a genuine friend and an honest critic of my music,” says Sudha Ragunathan. “His large heart and open mind made him appreciate good music, irrespective of the parampara,” she adds. Recording his condolences on social media, historian V. Sriram said “Carnatic music has lost a scholar and fine vainika in the passing of P. Vasanth Kumar, for long a committee member of the Music Academy, and above all a dear friend of mine... At the Madras Music Academy he was a committee member who knew his music theory and put it to good use.”",

"‘Them’ review: Amazon’s horror series does not provide the catharsis it is supposed to",
60,
"The poet was right about too much suffering making a stone of the heart. Little Marvin’s horror anthology, Them, is proof of the truth of the line from WB Yeats’ Easter 1916. How much punishment can the Emory family take from their racist neighbours and the malevolent spirits in their home before the viewers become comfortably numb? Also Read | Get ‘First Day First Show’, our weekly newsletter from the world of cinema, in your inbox. You can subscribe for free here Each one of the 10 episodes, including the controversial episodes 5 and 9, show the Emorys being subjected to every kind of abuse starting with killing the family dog to rape, blinding, and the stomach-turning killing of a baby. There have been conversations around exploitation of black trauma, and pandering to the white gaze, with the cast and crew defending their choices. Lena Waithe, who executive produced alongside creator Little Marvin, said, “The first season will speak to how frightening it was to be black in 1953.” The question is who is the show speaking to — white or black audiences? What is the purpose? To make the whites feel guilty or the blacks remember?And then there are the horror elements — covenants, creaking doors, creepy, dim basements, jump scares, incongruous mirror reflections, gothic mental asylums, lobotomised patients, and that hoary chestnut of whether the visions are real or in the character’s mind. Horror is meant to entertain — so are the makers using black trauma for entertainment? Or using horror as a metaphor? The very fact that so many questions were coursing through my mind as I slogged through the ten episodes meant, the show had made a stone of my heart with its earnest depiction of all the horrors visited upon a human mind and body. There have been similarities drawn to Jordan Peele 2019 film, Us, with a common actor, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Lovecraft Country, an anthology set in the same time period. While Lovecraft Country used fantasy, horror and sci-fi to explore themes of race and gender, it also told a ripping good yarn stylishly. Them is beautifully shot, clothed, scored and acted, and not at all engaging. Even as one luxuriates in the beautiful frames, one’s attention wanders to Pink Floyd’s psychedelic excursions in ‘Us and Them’. The dreamy number from the iconic 1973 album The Dark Side of the Moon, speaks of “black and blue” instead of the expected “black and white”, hinting at police cars and a severe beating perhaps? As mentioned, the cast is superb from Deborah Ayorinde as Lucky, the traumatised mother to Shahadi Wright Joseph and Melody Hurd who play her daughters, Ruby Lee and Gracie. Ashley Thomas is the head of the family, Henry, traumatised by the Second World War and the ingrained racism of his workspace. Alison Pill with flowing, flared out ‘50s skirts, the cinched waist, softly curling blond hair and disconcerting sloe-black eyes, is the chief antagonist, Betty. Her arc is the most frustrating as after leading the charge for most part, she is moved to the sidelines... never to return. The horror does not provide the catharsis it is supposed to, and after a point all the pretty frames and dresses fail to propel the story along, as we watch the Emory family face yet another sling and arrow from outrageous fortune — and no, there is no terrible beauty being born either.",

YouTube only asks that they consider factors including the subject matter of the video, whether the video has an emphasis on kids characters, themes, toys or games, and more.” Kids under 13 are protected by a 1998 federal law that requires parental consent before companies can collect and share their personal information.

"As the U.S. economy rebounds from its pandemic slump, a vital cog is in short supply: the computer chips that power a wide range of products that connect, transport and entertain us in a world increasingly dependent on technology. The shortage has already been rippling through various markets since last summer. It has made it difficult for schools to buy enough laptops for students f orced to learn from home, delayed the release of popular products such as the iPhone 12 and created mad scrambles to find the latest video game consoles such as the PlayStation 5. But things have been getting even worse in recent weeks, particularly in the auto industry, where factories are shutting down because there aren't enough chips to finish building vehicles that are starting to look like computers on wheels. The problem was recently compounded by a grounded container ship that blocked the Suez Canal for nearly a week, choking off chips headed from Asia to Europe. On Thursday, General Motors and Ford said they would further cut production at their North American factories as the global shortage of semiconductors appears to be growing tighter.",

"COVID cases hit a high of 2,187 in Ernakulam",
25,
"The number of new COVID-19 cases in Ernakulam soared to hit an all-time high of 2,187 on Saturday. The active caseload of the district has risen to 11,994. As part of the two-day mass testing drive organised to detect cases and curb the spread of infection, 20,180 samples were collected on Saturday. The district has surpassed its two-day target of 30,900 samples and has tested a total of 36,390 people on Friday and Saturday. The district administration is improving health infrastructure further to deal with the surge in cases. In an online briefing, District Collector S. Suhas said the recently inaugurated superspeciality block at the General Hospital would be taken over for COVID-19 treatment under the Disaster Management Act, and that 100 oxygen beds would be readied at the block in the next few days. The COVID care centre at the Fort Kochi Taluk Hospital, which had recently closed, will be restarted soon. In the next few days, 100 oxygen beds will be ready at the hospital, the Collector said. Although the district administration had earlier planned on closing the COVID care facility at PVS Hospital, it will now continue functioning at least for three weeks weeks to treat critically ill COVID patients. The district is relying on the 100-bed critical care facility at the Aluva District Hospital to handle the caseload. At least 15 new first-line treatment centres (FLTCs) will also begin functioning soon. The Kochi Corporation and municipalities have been directed to set up FLTCs. The administration is also considering increasing the number of admissions at the Government Medical College Hospital, where the number of COVID patients had dipped over the past two months after it was opened up for non-COVID treatment, said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission. Since non-COVID treatment and surgeries had resumed at private hospitals, most are finding it difficult to set aside beds and staff for COVID treatment, Dr. Numpeli said. However, private hospitals have been attempting to increase the number of beds set aside for COVID patients and are building their staff strength, he added. “Private hospitals have been directed to set aside 20% of their beds for COVID patients,” he said. The surge in cases has been straining the existing health care facilities. Although taluk hospitals and the Muvattupuzha General Hospital were equipped earlier to treat COVID patients, these facilities are also fast approaching their maximum capacity. Of the 1,056 ICU beds in the public and private sectors, 591 are occupied, while 148 out of 336 ventilators are in use. Of the 3,106 oxygen beds, 1,317 are occupied. Addressing the media earlier in the day, District Collector S. Suhas said the number of new cases crossing the 2,000-mark could be attributed to the testing strategy and the number of samples collected. “The main strategy now is to identify the maximum number of positive people. Vulnerable persons, including bus drivers and conductors, people at markets, people with symptoms, and contacts of patients, are being tested. This massive testing campaign will continue if resources are available. The impact of such a campaign will be visible around two weeks from now,” he said. Among new cases, Thrikkakara continues to top the list with 104 people testing positive from the area. Kalamassery recorded 79 cases, Thripunithura 69, Pallipuram 60, Sreemoolanagaram 59, Edathala 54, Palluruthy 45, Mazhuvannoor 44, Vengola 41, and Kadungalloor 40. In the Kochi Corporation limits, Kadavanthra registered 38 new cases, Fort Kochi 35, Edakochi 32, Palarivattom 30, Vyttila 29, Thoppumpady 26, and Kaloor 24. Two health workers and three police officers were among those who tested positive. A total of 327 people tested negative on Saturday, and 28,227 people remain in quarantine. While 8,394 people are recovering at home, 687 patients are admitted at private hospitals, 291 patients are recovering at COVID centres at government hospitals, and 380 people are at first- and second-line treatment centres.",

"The Election Commission on Friday ordered curbs on campaigning for the last three phases of the West Bengal election, including extending the silence period before voting from 48 to 72 hours and barring all campaigning from 7 p.m. to 10 a.m., in view of the rising COVID-19 cases. The EC said it observed violations of its August 2020 guidelines during the ongoing Assembly polls and warned parties that it wouldn’t hesitate in banning such events if it continued. “... the Commission has noted several instances of election meetings and campaigns wherein norms of social distancing, wearing of masks etc. have been flouted in blatant disregard of the Commission’s aforesaid guidelines ... in view of unprecedented public health concerns, the Commission is of considered view that the period of campaign for the remaining phases [phase 6, phase 7 and phase 8] of the elections in the State of West Bengal needs to be curtailed in larger public interest,” the order said. Invoking its plenary powers under Article 324 of the Constitution, the EC banned rallies, public meetings, street plays and nukkad sabhas between 7 p.m. and 10 a.m. starting from Friday, on any day that campaigning is allowed. In addition, the EC extended the “silence period” before polling from 48 hours to 72 hours for the three phases. Campaigning would end at 6.30 p.m. on April 19, April 23 and April 26 respectively for the sixth, seventh and eighth phases. The EC also wrote to all national and State parties to reiterate its guidelines on social distancing, mask-wearing and other precautions for campaigning. The EC told the parties and candidates to ensure that the guidelines are followed. “Violations if any shall be sternly dealt with and action, including criminal action, taken as per extant legal framework,” the EC told the parties.

"The number of COVID-19 cases in the second wave is higher than the peak last year, said Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash. Launching COVID-19 screening centres in the city, he said the number of cases detected a day had touched 2,500, which was higher than last year. “We have increased the samples to 20,000 every day. We will increase the samples to 25,000 shortly. The case load will decrease by testing, isolating and treating the positive cases. We have created screening centres at 12 locations for positive patients,” Mr. Prakash said. The civic body is planning to increase the number of screening centres to more than 15 shortly. Residents who have tested positive are requested to visit the screening centres. The Corporation has deployed more than 20,000 employees for COVID-19 duty and has made arrangements for transportation of patients in vehicles to the screening centres. “COVID-19 positive residents can also come to the screening centres in their own vehicles without waiting for Corporation vehicles. We have 500 medical officers on COVID-19 duty,” Mr. Prakash said. The number of COVID-19 vaccinations in the city has crossed 50,000 per day because of awareness programmes by healthcare officials. The Corporation has planned to cover more than eight lakh residents above 45 years in two weeks. Answering queries pertaining to the death of actor Vivekh, Mr. Prakash said senior officers of the Health Department had explained that the death was not because of the side effects of vaccination. Corporation Joint Commissioner (Health) Alby John Varghese said more than 1.33 lakh residents above 45 years had taken the second dose and there were reports of only minor side effects such as fever. The screening centres are Tiruvottiyur urban community health centre; Madhavaram General Hospital; Tondiarpet Communicable Diseases Hospital; Ayanavaram ESI Hospital; Community halls in Mogappair and Harrington Road; ICDS Centre, Anderson Road, Nungambakkam; Chennai Higher Secondary School, Nesapakkam; Hussaini School, Porur; NSTI, Guindy; and Teachers Training University, Sholinganallur.",

"Amid the surge in COVID-19 cases, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said he had spoken to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan about the shortage of oxygen, beds and essential medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab in the Capital. Mr. Kejriwal said the government was in the process of adding 6,000 beds across various facilities over the coming three-four days and requested the Centre for assistance. He added that the weekend curfew, which came into effect at 10 p.m. on Friday night and will remain in force till 5 a.m. on Monday, was put in place out of “compulsion” and the government was constantly monitoring the situation. If the gravity of the surge in the city increases further, Mr. Kejriwal said the government would take “any step” to ensure the safety and health of the citizens. “With the pace at which COVID is spreading, none of us know when it will reach its peak,” he said at a digital briefing. “I told Dr. Vardhan there is a huge shortage of beds in Delhi. In November, the Centre allotted us 4,100 beds. This time, they have provided 1,800 beds even though this wave is three times more fatal than the previous ones,” he added. There are around 10,000 beds under the Centre in Delhi of which at least 50% must be reserved for COVID-19, he said, adding: “At AIIMS, there are 1,162 beds out of which only 23 are reserved for COVID patients.” On test results taking 3-4 days instead of 24 hours, the Chief Minister said strict action would be taken against labs that accept more samples than their capacity and do not provide results in 24 hours.",

"Can Covaxin booster dose prolong protection?",
25,
"In a meeting held on March 24, the Subject Expert Committee of the India drug regulator permitted Bharat Biotech to carry out a phase-2 trial of Covaxin wherein a booster dose is to be administered six months after the second dose to further improve vaccine efficacy. Currently, two doses of Covaxin are administered 28 days apart. In the phase-2 trial 380 participants were recruited in all and were split into two groups of 190 each to receive either 3 microgram or 6 microgram of the vaccine. With the SEC directing Bharat Biotech to conduct the booster dose study only in the cohort that received 6 microgram of the vaccine, the phase-2 booster dose trial will be limited to 190 participants. The booster dose will be given six months after the second dose and the company has been directed to follow up the participants who get a booster dose for at least six months. Virologist Dr. Jacob John, formerly with CMC Vellore, feels that providing a booster dose will be a good idea in increasing the duration of protection. “The immunological principle says that to make long-lived antibody secreting cells as well as long-lived memory T cells, the first and second dose should be given 28 days apart and the third dose should be given with a minimum gap of four months after the second dose and optimally five months after the second dose,” he says. According to him, when only two doses of the vaccine are given with a gap of 28 days between doses, the immunity would last for about a year or so. “So if the disease is around for more than a year, then a booster dose is needed after a year if only two doses are given one month apart,” says Dr. John. “The reason being that the first dose is a priming dose while the second dose given 28 days later is partially priming and partially boosting. As a result, the boosting effect of the second dose is short-lived, which is about a year.” Since Covaxin uses an inactivated virus platform, the virus does not multiply in the body and so the antigen level is maximum only for a day or two. In order to stimulate the immune system, a second dose is needed. He warns that when the second dose is given less than 28 days after the first, no boosting effect is achieved, and when given after 28 days, the booster effect is only partial and will last for about a year. So a booster dose will be needed after a year if the disease is around. “If the third dose is administered four–five months after the second dose, the immunological principle is that the immunity will be long-lived. This is because the antibody secreting cells will be treated specially by the body and will be taken into the bone marrow and will live for years and continue secreting antibodies,” Dr. John says. North Arcot study He recalls the North Arcot (in Tamil Nadu) Polio study of 1986–95 where the inactivated polio vaccine was tested as three doses under the government’s watch. As required by ICMR, the study compared oral polio vaccine (OPV) and the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). While the CDC recommends four doses, most countries use three doses of inactivated polio vaccine. In the beginning, three doses of inactivated polio vaccine were given, with the second and third doses given with one month gap. But even after three doses a booster was needed a year later. But the second dose given with at least eight weeks gap after the first resulted in higher antibody levels and longer duration of protection. However, a booster dose is still required and so the third dose is given a year after the second dose. In the North Arcot Polio study of 1986–1995, Dr. John and his team administered the first dose at 14 weeks and the second dose 22 weeks later. The third dose was administered at nine months of age. “Polio almost disappeared,” Dr. John vividly recalls. Despite the very encouraging results of the study, the government dumped inactivated polio vaccine and instead went ahead using oral polio vaccine to combat polio in the country. Unfortunately, even the results of the study were not published. Drop in cases But in 1998, Dr. John and three others included the critical data of the North Arcot Polio study in a paper in The Lancet. The paper dealing with district-level disease surveillance showed that increasing vaccine coverage both in private and public health facilities resulted in a substantial drop in the prevalence of vaccine-preventable diseases. In the case of polio, the drop was from 150 cases in private hospitals and 116 cases in government hospitals in 1989 to just 14 polio cases in private hospitals and five cases in government hospitals six years later in 1995. “The intervention was not to eradicate but to contain polio,” says Dr. John recalling the study. Even in the case of the HPV vaccine, three doses were initially given, with the second dose given a month after the first and the third dose given at six months. “Scientists soon found that the second dose was irrelevant. If the gap between the first and second dose is more than five months then a third dose is not required,” he says. “Protection between the first and second dose is not good. But since there is no pandemic and we don’t need short-term protection, the second dose of HPV is generally administered six months later. If both short-term and long-term protection is needed then three doses at 0-1-6 months interval are needed for HPV.”",

"A song that’s now a Dalit anthem",
38,
"The song may be nearly four decades old, but its nuanced use in recent films has given it a new resonance among the oppressed classes. As the heroine enters in Karnan, the latest Dhanush starrer, playing in the background is ‘Poraadada, Vaalenthada,’ played on the nagaswaram, accompanied by ‘naiyaandi melam’. The film’s director, Mari Selvaraj, seems to be enchanted by this song. He had also used it in his previous work, Pariyerum Perumal. Originally composed in 1983, for the film Alai Osai, in which actor Vijayakant played the lead role, the song has now become an anthem of sorts for Dalits; and the voice of those who stand up against oppression. Mari Selvaraj’s film has actually captured the song’s popularity among Dalits in the southern districts of the State. The song is also featured in marriages. “In the past, there used to be a request from the audience to play it once or twice. Now I don’t know how many times I play it during a temple festival (kodai). Another ‘naiyandi melam’ player told me that he had played it 50 times in a temple in Kanniyakumari district in three days,” said ‘naiyandi melam’ artiste and nagaswaram player Panakudi Siva. The audience, particularly the youth, will make a beeline to offer money to the nagaswaram player before requesting him to render the song. In Karnan, the tune was played by the troupe of Ramanathapuram-based P. Marungan, one of the leading ‘naiyandi melam’ artistes. He and his troupe also played for other songs in the film. One can listen to him and other troupe playing ‘Poraadada’ on YouTube. Asked about the song’s popularity, Ilayabharathi, the poet who penned it, said he was happy that it had struck a chord with the people. “Even after four decades, its message seems to be evergreen,” he said, while acknowledging the opportunity given to him by music director Ilaiyaraaja and film director Sirumugai Ravi to write the song. But performers should be careful about playing the song in the temples of other communities, where it may not be taken lightly, because in its ‘saranam’ there is a reference to Dalit communities. “One of my friends was let off with a warning for playing the song in a temple run by caste Hindus. But it will not happen in all places,” recalled Mr. Siva.",

37,
"The Anchalik Gana Morcha (AGM), a constituent of the Opposition Congress-led ‘Mahajoot’ in Assam, on April 11 urged the Election Commission of India (ECI) to videograph the May 2 counting of the Assembly elections in the State. In a letter to the EC, AGM president and the Rajya Sabha member Ajit Kumar Bhuyan said the Commission has to depend on the State bureaucracy in the entire process of the Assembly elections, and claimed that there is an “apprehension” that some sections of the employees may favour the ruling BJP and “can do mischief in the counting”. “To make the counting process fair and transparent we urge the Hon’ble Forum [EC] to take all such possible steps as provided in the Conduct of Election Rule, 1961 as well as the notifications issued by the Commission from time to time. One such step towards transparency would be to do videography of the entire counting process,” the party chief said in the letter. The AGM said the videography of the counting will ensure transparency in the counting process and there will be no scope for any party or individual to raise any grievance regarding manipulation in the counting process. The three-phase Assembly elections were held on March 27, April 1 and April 6. The regional party claimed that a lot of controversy had erupted during the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections and “this has cast doubts on the impartiality in the counting process”. The AGM said provision for videography is available in case of re-verification or re-counting if victory is decided only on account of postal ballot counting. The party urged the EC “to remove any apprehension in any quarter” and conduct videography of the entire counting process “without compromising the secrecy of voting”. The AGM said it has full faith in the impartiality of the EC “but at the same time we want to warn the possible stealing of verdict of the people by manipulation that may be caused by unscrupulous persons which will ultimately mar the reputation of the Election Commission of India”, it said.",

37,
"The move by the grand alliance or mahajot in Assam to shift their “potentially winning candidates” in the just concluded Assembly elections to Congress-ruled Rajasthan indicates the minute detail being worked out by the Congress’ election managers. The thinking within the party seems to be that if it manages to reclaim Assam, once its stronghold, then the same campaign model can be replicated in Uttar Pradesh. The party has already named Rajesh Tiwari, a close aide of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, as a secretary in U.P., a State handled by Priyanka Gandhi-Vadra. Apart from being a sign of things to come, it also indicates the importance attached to the Assam results. An electoral success in Assam will also be crucial for Mr. Baghel’s standing in the party as his team has been closely involved in election planning in the State. The Chhattisgarh Chief Minister, who was appointed as the party's observer, not only ensured that the Congress didn’t face any “resource crunch” but also provided crucial manpower to carry out ground surveys and voter feedback. He is also credited with the strategy to involve Ms. Vadra to campaign among women tea workers in the Upper Assam, a traditional voting segment that had deserted the Congress in 2016. The party, in its assessment, believes a swing in the tea garden votes will change its poll fortunes, catapulting Mr. Baghel to the political Hindi heartland of U.P. “The next area of exploration for Team Chhattisgarh will be Uttar Pradesh if things go as per plan,” a senior leader said. Success in Assam will also cement Mr. Baghel’s position as Chief Minister — a post that was originally meant to rotate between him and his Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo, who had helmed the party’s campaign in Chhattisgarh.",

Institutions that sign the GATI charter will adopt gender equality principles and create Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound (SMART) action plans for systemic and cultural transformation. In an interaction, Barbara Wickham OBE, Director, British Council India, delves into the framework’s importance, its potential to transform the Higher Education sector and how GATI’s salient features are aligned to the NEP 2020.How will the higher education sector make use of GATI? GATI is a joint programme based on a highly successful initiative implemented in the UK: the Athena Swan charter. The British Council is the facilitator, creating ties between Indian stakeholders and U.K. institutions to achieve the desired transformation. The project aims to create a new ecosystem that builds competencies of Indian institutions and enables them to establish sustainable partnerships with UK institutions who have already begun their gender equality journey for mutual learning. GATI aims to nudge higher education institutions (HEIs) and research organisations to better support diversity and inclusion for talent progression, and establish an enabling environment for equal participation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Medicine and Mathematics (STEMM) at all levels by addressing systemic challenges. It seeks to increase recruitment, retention, and women’s progression throughout their professional journeys. Could you explain how the self-assessment and accreditation process will work? A significant aspect of GATI is that it can test, accredit and recognise organisations through a GATI Award, which will be along the same lines as the Athena Swan award in the UK. The GATI framework can also assist institutions in meeting the requirements and expectations of national and international funders and research councils. Institutions can identify areas for positive action and share good practice with other institutions. Adopting the GATI framework will also support the promotion of inclusive working practices that can increase retention of valued women academics and support staff by demonstrating an institution’s commitment to an equitable working environment. Through GATI, the aim is to inspire senior leaders such as vice-chancellors and directors to take every possible action to attract, hire and promote more women in STEM fields in India. Universities, research institutions and institutes of national importance that sign up will pledge to embrace its principles in their policies, practices, action-plans and organisational set up. A metric-based evaluation method is being designed for institutions to compete for the award. Participating organisations will be provided with training and support at every stage and will also be partnered with UK institutions who have enormous experience on similar gender equality charters. They will be shortlisted on their commitment to promoting gender equality, as evidenced by currently implemented gender policies and ongoing gender-enabling programmes and activities. What do institutions need to do as part of the action plan? GATI will guide institutions in collecting data to determine if barriers exist and what can be done to tackle them. As much as increasing the number of women in STEM is crucial to promote gender balance, equal representation alone will not automatically remove the barriers to gender equality. Advancement of gender equality involves removing the structural barriers, including social, cultural, and economic, which prevent female students, faculty and staff from achieving their potential.",

"Create a learning community",
24,
"Like most young Indians, I got into an engineering college but was not really interested in it. The syllabus was outdated, and I felt my professors lacked enough real-world professional experience in their respective fields. This dissatisfaction led to the discovery of the valuable world of online learning communities, through social media groups. While social media is a way to connect with people, it also has many focus-based communities. Learning is also a social experience. Focus-based online communities on social media platforms such as Facebook, Discord, and Reddit simulate this up to a point. Not only do these groups give one a real-world taste of how the system works, but also give an opportunity to interact with active industry professionals that one wouldn’t have access to otherwise. This helps pick up the ‘language’ of the industry and also some initial leads. Take the example of Harvard’s CS50x, an online course available for free, on an ed-tech platform. To ease community engagement between online course-takers, CS50x uses a Facebook group in which students can ask questions, clear doubts, celebrate their small wins when they complete assignments, and also participate in group events. Students sometimes organise themselves into small study-groups as well, to do collective course-work. Another aspect of social media acting as a catalyst to learning can be attributed to educational content creators (individuals with a level of mastery in their field). Choosing to follow the right creators and consuming their content daily can enrich your thinking and put your learning in the right direction, as you are taking the information from someone who has already done what you are about to do. On the flip-side, this choice of whose content you can consume can also put you at risk of falling into echo-chambers leading to the formation of a confirmation bias. The community aspect of social media has been in use for learning purposes for the past decade. The ed-tech sector in India is currently tapping into this space, trying to leverage all of its possibilities, and ultimately moving the entire learning experience to the digital space.",

"The traditional education system has long been criticised for curbing a student’s natural creative ability. What do we mean by creativity? Creativity is an active process and requires skill as well as a specific understanding of the context. It develops critical thinking, collaboration, problem-solving, imagination, communication, agility, and empathy, all vital traits to survive and succeed. This is where Technology Enhanced Learning comes in. While technology in education has been around for some time, the pandemic has accelerated its growth. Engaged and authentic learning through technology has resulted in higher retention and comprehension rates, increased learner satisfaction and introduced creativity to an age-old process. Technologies such as 3D videos, simulations and augmented reality have created an immersive experience for learners and enabled the sharing of knowledge and information in creative and dynamic ways. New tools and innovations also help make online learning more user-friendly, provide more space for experimentation and expose learners to new ideas. This leads to creative applications in local contexts, which is further helped by Internet penetration and development of newer technologies. Moreover, it also assists educators in becoming more effective teachers by revolutionising methodologies with new-age tools. According to reports and studies published by World Economic Forum, students learning through online modules retain anywhere between 25-60% more material compared to regular classrooms. This is because students find interactive learning more engaging. When information involves a fun element, the delivery process becomes more efficient. Also, doing, seeing and hearing helps comprehension as demonstrated by Edgar Dale’s Cone of Learning. Experiential learning, which involves ‘learning by doing’, is another way to enhance creativity. Coding and creating applications are a technological way to reinforcing creativity and critical thinking. One primary barrier to creativity in education institutions is the curriculum and traditional pedagogy. Keeping in mind the ever-changing landscape of education, we need to re-design the traditional function of education institutions and methods of learning and develop a more flexible, balanced and skill-based curriculum that will include diverse and cross-curricular activities to ensure more participation. Parents and educators need to appreciate and emphasise the joy of creativity. The boost to self-confidence and self-esteem are key to emotional well being and healthy social development. Finally, creativity provides a platform to improvise on old ideas and create breakthroughs in the world of art, science and technology.",

Those who are now in Class 8 will be the first batch to experience the new curricular framework and assessment system, starting next year, according to the Department of School Education and Literacy’s plans to turn the NEP’s proposals into reality in schools. Also read | New education policy aims to achieve twin objectives of inclusion, excellence: President Kovind 300 tasks So far, the department has identified 300 tasks for a wide range of implementing agencies — both within and beyond the Education Ministry — to carry out over the next five years, according to a presentation prepared for stakeholders last week. This will ensure implementation of new policies, from early childhood education and functional literacy and numeracy to mother tongue medium education and revamped teacher training. “These are the proposed timelines being circulated as draft for feedback,” School Education Secretary Anita Karwal told The Hindu on Saturday. The starting point is the National Curriculum Framework, which will be prepared by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), for school education and for adult education by 2021. The State Councils of Educational Research and Training (SCERTs) are expected to adapt and adopt this new curriculum at the State level by 2022. The NCERT and SCERTs will redesign textbooks in three phases between 2021 and 2024. Editorial | A long road: On National Education Policy 2020 Students currently in Class 8 will start using the new curriculum, textbooks and assessment system in the next academic year 2021-22, as they enter Class 9, and will continue to be pioneers for the new framework as they move up the school till Class 12.",

"Gautam Sen’s latest book is on India’s historic fascination with automobiles",
24,
"Glitz and glamour, a need for speed and an unquenchable thirst to succeed in the field of four wheelers has paved the foundation for the automobile industry in India. Ever since 1897, when the British and Indian royalty paraded these ‘horseless wonders’, the rest of the population has viewed cars as status symbols. In The Automobile, author Gautam Sen follows the route of the first car to make tracks on Indian shores, going down the years post Independence when a need to mass produce four wheelers took shape, culminating in the country’s offering in the sportscar sector as recent as 2020. “Though this book has been in the writing for the past four years, some of the research that has gone into the book goes back almost 15-20 years,” says Gautam, over phone from Paris. Gautam, who founded India’s first news-stand auto magazine in 1986, adds, “I was always interested in knowing about the past and having been in the field of motor-centered magazines since the ‘80s, I would come across specific models or certain collectors. Researching them led to unearthing a lot of historic detail.” Royal rides The book is dotted with fascinating nuggets of history. Like how the Maharaja of Nawanagar, popularly called Ranji (yes, he of Ranji Trophy fame) was the very first Indian to drive his own automobile. Or how Maharajkumar Bhupal Singh of Mewar, who was paralysed from the waist down, had a special hand-controlled Rolls Royce he could use by himself as far back as 1923. Even as they kept up with the British, Indian rajas and members of the princely families, took to modifying the basic structure of the car to suit their personal tastes. Often bordering on the ostentatious or simply garish — zenana cars, hunting vehicles complete with a sunroof as a turret and others cutomised with cocktail cabinets and detachable spittons — were just a few of the many specimens they flaunted. Collector items It was not long before wealthy professionals of the day began to acquire cars, and it is partly due to their efforts and passion that many vintage cars disposed off by royalty found second homes. Many rare cars such as the 1939 Delahaye 135MS, Rolls Royce Phantom II Continental, SS100 Jaguar, Lancia Astura and the likes, have been restored and housed by many across the country with a penchant for four-wheeled beauties. While many of these vehicles are part private collections, some collectors have opened museums, giving laymen the opportunity to view these marvels — the Vintage Car Museum in Ahmedabad, the Heritage Transport Museum in Haryana and the Gedee Car Museum in Coimbatore are prime examples. Screen presence As passionate as he is about vehicles, Gautam says the portion of the book he most enjoyed penning was the part where he explores the role of automobiles in art, literature and cinema. He recounts watching the Hindi movie Apradh as a child, back in 1972. Starring Feroz Khan and Mumtaz, the film began with its opening credits rolling over a racing sequence. “That was really disappointing, but I would wait for another amazing car race that would conclude by the 57th minute of the movie and then leave the theatre,” he says. “What is extraordinary is that the racing sequence was shot with actual rally racers of the day. I was able to trace Rene Herzog, one of the racers from that movie, and talked to him at length.” Herzog, now 73, was a professional rallyist who raced with legends such as Niki Lauda. He remembers the Indian movie sequence shot at the Nürburgring F1 track in Germany, and being captivated by the beautiful Mumtaz. Gautam includes anecdotes from other members of the film fraternity passionate about their cars. From yesteryear movie stars such as Salim Khan and Raj Kapoor, to actors Mehmood and Jackie Shroff, a dazzling range of historic vehicles have been (and still are) in their possession. An Indian love story With his brand of barbed humour, Gautam has not shirked from calling a spade a spade, while recounting the debacles of the colonial rulers of our past or the despotic ‘desi’ ones post-Independence. From Sanjay Gandhi’s botched handling of the Maruti project and the all-encompassing miasma of red tape in India, to the unprecedented success of the Nano abroad and India’s infamous track record with hosting international rallying events, Gautam tells it as it is.",

"The year 1857 catches at our collective imagination: the heroic, doomed endeavour, the mix of high and low who joined the fight for freedom, the horrific reprisals. Murder at the Mushaira begins on the moonlit night of May 2, 1857, with a messenger galloping to Delhi carrying a letter for the rebels, a posse of East India Company soldiers in hot pursuit. It ends in September with the uprising’s defeat and a whole city, its traditions and way of life, systematically dismembered. In between, in the run-up to the uprising, there is a murder during a mushaira at the grand haveli of Nawab Iftikar Hasan. The victim, a poet called Sukhan Khairabadi, has been stabbed to death with an agate-handled dagger. He is a rather dodgy character, thought to be a spy in the pay of the East India Company, and worse, a second-rate poet. Company officials, already uneasy over the widespread anger over greased cartridges, fear the murder is connected to a broader discontent.",
